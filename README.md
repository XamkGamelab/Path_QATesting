HOW TO PLAY
Your goal is to aling incoming platforms with previously placed platforms. When ever a platforms is not alinged it cuts of the out of bounds part of it.
Platforms will be coming from two sides and you can stop them by clicking left-mouse-button. 
There is also a rotation mechanic which allows you to rotate the platform to kind of reset its lenght. This can be done by pressing 'a' on your keyborad.
Game is lost when you miss the platform.

In short:
- Left-mouse-button to place platforms
- 'a' to rotate a platform
